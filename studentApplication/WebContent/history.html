	<p style="padding: 100px;font-size: 20px">Students of Don Bosco School refer to themselves as 'Bosconians' and prefer to call their school 'Bosco' in short form. The school does not have an official mascot or flag, but versions of the school's logo which encompasses an eagle flying high over the school building are used on several occasions like the Annual Athletics Meet.
A house system has been implemented with each student being divided amongst the four school houses: Gold, Red, Blue and Green. Points are awarded to each student's house for any kind of distinction, and deducted for misbehavior.
The school's motto is 'Ever More and Better Ever'. There are 13 classes - Kindergarten to Grade 12, and four sections in each class. The Student's Council is composed of 17 leaders.
It has recently been amongst the first schools to adopt the Don Bosco Child Policy and Don Bosco Child Protection Policy for India, both that were unveiled in the school's auditorium by dignitaries.</p>
